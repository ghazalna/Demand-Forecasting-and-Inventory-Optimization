# Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization using Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform **Demand Forecasting** and **Inventory Optimization** using Python. 

- **Demand Forecasting**: Estimating future customer demand based on historical data using models like ARIMA, SARIMA, etc.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Managing inventory levels to meet demand without overstocking or understocking, using strategies like Reorder Points, Safety Stock, and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ).

## Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical sales data and relevant external factors (e.g., seasonality, promotions).
2. **Forecasting Models**: Use SARIMA or other time series models to predict demand.
3. **Inventory Optimization**: Optimize inventory based on forecasted demand.
    - **Optimal Order Quantity (EOQ)**
    - **Reorder Point**
    - **Safety Stock**
    - **Total Cost Calculation**

## Results

- **Optimal Order Quantity**: `236` units
- **Reorder Point**: `235.25` units
- **Safety Stock**: `114.45` units
- **Total Cost**: `561.80` units
